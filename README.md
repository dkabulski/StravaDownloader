simple api get to pull all strava activities into a DF &amp; google spreadsheet


Rather simple code to ilustrate Strava API methods for authentication and basic data pulls. Extra is the google drive connection (using it as mounted drive works similarly to mounted datalake).

Enjoy!

setup needed: head over to https://www.strava.com/settings/api and request API keys (register your app)

useful resources (I recommend using postman to run tests): https://developers.strava.com/docs/reference/
